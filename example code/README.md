# Example

## notes

this code is from this website:

![https://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-family-tree](https://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-family-tree)

(note: this only works with local testing)

reminder: this is the command for that:

``` shell
python -m http.server
```

## usage

this works the same way as lists do, the css file is where the magic happens.

note: using the a tag is not necessary but prob makes stuff look better.

so instead of

``` html
<a>
```

we can use anything we want
